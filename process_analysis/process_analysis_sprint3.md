### Process Model Analysis Document Sprint 3

### Definition of Our Process:
Our process continues to be structured around three weekly meetings, focusing on code discussion, design reviews, problem-solving, task allocation, and progress tracking. Each meeting involves a note-taker documenting discussions in our **`meeting_notes.md`** file, and a SCRUM master who translates these notes into tasks or issues on our GitHub Projects kanban board. Tasks are assigned based on individual roles within the web server project.

### Process Elements Description:
The process initiates with the meetings, where tasks are recognized and assigned to team members. Each member addresses these tasks in their own branches, followed by creating a pull request (PR). Our PR process adheres to a structured template including description, changes made, testing status, and additional information. GitHub labels like features, bugs, documentation, etc., are used for categorization. GitHub Actions automate tests and linting on PRs.

### Process vs. Process Model:
The process comprises the actual activities (meetings, coding, PRs), while the process model, an Agile/SCRUM methodology, provides the theoretical framework guiding these activities. Our model emphasizes continuous integration, regular meetings, and iterative development, with occasional deviations due to project constraints or team dynamics.

### Evolution of Process:
Our process has evolved to include a PR template, a formal code review template, and integrated GitHub Actions for automatic testing and linting. We have recently re-established our label system for clearer categorization and started presenting code in SCRUM meetings. These enhancements aim to streamline our workflow and maintain high code quality standards.

### Reasons for Changes:
The refinements to our process were implemented to enhance workflow efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and uphold code quality standards. Automating routine checks allows the team to concentrate more on core development tasks.

### Current Challenges:
Challenges include refining the comment section for reviews and enhancing HTML/CSS styling. Feedback from earlier sprints highlighted the need for a more robust code review process and comprehensive user stories.

### Proposed Improvements:
To tackle these challenges, we propose more frequent and documented code reviews on branches and involving every team member in the PR review process. A structured approach to HTML/CSS styling is also a priority.

### Implementation Strategy:
The implementation of these improvements requires active participation from each team member. Specific roles, such as code reviewers or UI/UX specialists, may be assigned. Progress will be monitored through regular meetings and SCRUM updates, ensuring alignment with our project goals and agile methodology.
