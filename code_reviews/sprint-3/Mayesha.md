# Code reviews end of sprint-3

## Code Review for Brady 
Brady has wroked on all the modules under data_management file. Good implementation of db_schema.py that contains SQL statements to create the necessary tables for a database. It is missing docstrings but it is still easy to read and understand. The data_store.py and object mapper.py is modular and uses DRY/SOLID principals, and it also contains doctrings and it is PEP8 compliant. Brady has also done an excellent job with writing all the code for templates and copying the header onto every page wherever necessary.

## Code Review for Cody
Cody has written codes for the Server module. Docstrings are well implemented. The routing and method definitions are clear and easy to understand. Could've made the code design more modular by separating route handlers and logic. There is more room for improvement, for example, logging in with invalid credentials causes the server to crash.

## Code Review for Martha
Functionality of codes are easy to understand with the provide doctrings, it is also PEP8 compliant. Excellent use of '@property' to handle JSON data files. Overall, Martha's code is well-structured and demonstrates good OOP practices, with a focus on modularity and reusability. Martha has also added some CSS styling which improves the readability and visual aesthetics.
