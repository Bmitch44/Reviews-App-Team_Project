## Martha Snelgrove
Martha worked mostly on the refactoring and bug fixes, adhering to DRY and SOLID principles. DRY was used well, using the base class allowed for increased efficiency. Martha’s docstrings were implemented well, complying with PEP 8 and passing the linter. 

## Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha’s code is well documented, with proper PEP 8 compliant docstrings (passes the linter). However, Mayesha sometimes struggled with implementing some things, such as the search review method, which required guidance to fully implement. Could be fixed by having a more complete understanding of the server as a whole. Mayesha’s code is compliant and effectively uses the DRY/SOLID principles. 

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady’s code was well documented as well, and has proper PEP 8 compliant docstrings. His code is modular and efficient and effectively uses the DRY/SOLID principles. Brady added additional functionality to the templates that worked well. Additionally, Brady’s code passed the unit tests and passed the linter.

## Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh did not implement any code this sprint, therefore a code review cannot be given.
