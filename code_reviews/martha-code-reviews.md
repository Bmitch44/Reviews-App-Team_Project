## Cody Cribb - `server_app.py`
- solid documentation
- overall well written and effective
- needs implementation of try/except blocks for error handling

## Mayesha Jashim - `user_info.py` and `session_management.py`
- Excellent documentation
- modular design is clear and effective
- both `user_info.py` and  `session_management.py` need added error handling with try/except blocks to prevent the server crashing due to unexpected information

## Brady Mitchelmore - `src/data_management`
- good documentation 
- overall well written
- no real contributions or errors that I see to implement.
