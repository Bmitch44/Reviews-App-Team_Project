# Performance Reviews

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady was a great team member to work with. He uploaded his modules first and we all could use his code to decide what changes we might need to make to our code, such as adding docstrings. He was also very active in the group and approved pull request and pointed out bugs in our codes being very helpful the entire time. He performed as note taker and scrum master a couple times and he is very oriented.

## Martha Snelgrove
Martha was a good team member to work with. She always participated in meetings and she's very good at making plans and decisions when she is given the role of note taker or even scrum master. Martha is very cooperative and writes codes that are easy to understand. She always meets the deadlines and was active throughout the entire project. 

## Cody Cribb
Cody has been really helpful in putting the team together and make the project work by taking the workload of two members. He is good as a note taker, as well as a scrum master. He engages in the meetings and addresses issues and concerns and how we can progress with our project. 

## Vaansh Chaudhary
Vaansh has attented meetings for the first week only when we were assigning tasks. He hasn't been to any of the meetings after that. He also did not put in any effort for this project and was out of reach. He was contacted several times to attend meeting, if not then do his work load but unfortunately there was no response from his side.
