# Performance Reviews Sprint 3

### Martha Snelgrove
Martha has shown commendable performance in her dual roles as note-taker and SCRUM master, contributing significantly to the team's organization and efficiency. She exhibits strong technical skills, evident in her prompt implementation of project components. Martha's growing understanding of complex coding concepts, such as the @property decorator, is also noteworthy. However, there are areas where Martha could improve. She completed CSS styling tasks a bit late, which has impacted project timelines. Additionally, her limited contribution to architecture diagrams and less active participation in team meetings suggest a need for a more engaged and holistic approach to the project. To enhance her performance, it would be beneficial for Martha to start CSS tasks earlier in the sprint cycle, engage more in creating architecture diagrams, and participate more actively in team discussions.

### Cody Cribb
Cody has been an asset to the team, excelling in his roles as note-taker and SCRUM master. His proactive maintenance of the server_app.py file and development of efficient coding methods, such as the login_check() method, demonstrate his technical acumen. However, Cody has faced challenges, including delays and bugs in his implementations, indicating a need for more robust testing. His less active role in team meetings could also impact team synergy. To further his development, Cody should focus on implementing a rigorous testing phase before finalizing his code. Encouraging him to participate more actively in team meetings will also enhance collaboration. Allocating specific time for test creation within the project timeline could ensure more reliable and timely code development.

### Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha has consistently performed well in her roles as note-taker and SCRUM master. Her proactive approach to addressing errors in her work and timely completion of initial tasks highlight her strong work ethic and time management skills. However, Mayesha's latest sprint lacked significant coding contributions, particularly in CSS styling, and her input in architecture diagrams was minimal. Additionally, her understanding of the system's interconnectivity and functionality outside her specific code area seems limited, as reflected in her less active participation in team meetings. To improve, Mayesha should be encouraged to collaborate more on coding tasks and be more involved in creating architecture diagrams. Providing her with additional support or training could enhance her understanding of the system as a whole. Fostering more engagement in team meetings would also improve her integration with the team's dynamics.

### Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh's performance continues to be a concern. His consistent absence from team meetings and failure to fulfill roles such as note-taking and SCRUM master have negatively impacted the team dynamic. His lack of contribution to the project for several months, despite attempts to contact him, has placed an additional burden on other team members. Addressing Vansh's non-participation may require formal intervention with the project supervisor or course instructor. We had to redistribute his responsibilities among other team members or seek additional support to maintain project progress.
