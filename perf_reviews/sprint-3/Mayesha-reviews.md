## Performance Reviews for Sprint 3

## Martha Snelgrove
Martha always gets her task done by the time the deadline approaches. She does not really update her progress but she has proven herself to be reliable and she takes responsibility for the tasks assigned to her. All of her work is correct and compatible with the rest of the modules. This time she even completed all the tasks assigned to her, including the CSS styling which we decided to work on together, she did the greater half of it. She reached out during finals week and took the responsibility of completing the CSS styling which I had completed halfway. She was careful enough not to work on my portion so we didn’t run into conflicts. She is very good at communicating which is why we don’t face many conflicts in the code. She has done a good job as a scrum master and note-taker.

## Cody Cribb
Cody has performed well as a note-taker and a scrum master. During this sprint, he did not commit his code changes and lost his progress which is why we got slowed down a little, but he was quick to re-do all his work and push it. Cody checked up on us with our progress every now and then. Cody always communicates when he's facing issues and is responsive in the group chat when someone is having issues. Cody used postman for his code demonstration which made his presentation remarkable.

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady is the most team member among us. Brady has performed his role as note-taker and sprint master. He kept track of all the minor tasks we had to complete, such as the architecture diagrams and incomplete tasks from the last sprint. We had to postpone a few meetings when he was travelling. However, he still attended the online meetings when he was away travelling and sick. He is very diligent. He always leaves helpful reviews under the pull requests. He even recommended few sources to help me learn CSS and he is just very helpful overfall.

## Vaansh Chaudhury
Vaansh was absent during the entire sprint.
