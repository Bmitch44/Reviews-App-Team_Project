# Performance Reviews Sprint 3

### Brady Mitchelmore
Brady is an extremely attentive and helpful team member. Brady has performed his role as note-taker and sprint master. He took the lead on all of our architecture diagrams and documentaion. He completed all his assigned tasks and was helpful when others ran into issues. He was dilligent about attending meetings even as he was travelling. 

### Cody Cribb
Cody's active implementation and his updates to his files such as his login_check() menthod show his proficiency in working in this team. He faced some delays when a fetch overwrote his work forcing him to re-do all of his coding work. This delayed my css code as I couldn't view the reviews page of the html due to bugs. However it wasn't a terrible delay. While he could contribute some more in meetings when he does speak his contributions are clear and helpful. He was an effective note-taker and scrum master.

### Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha was an effective SCRUM master and note-taker. She was active in and attended all team meetings. We worked together to complete the css for the html templates, we collaborated effectively with me finishing the project after she did the login and logout screens. She completed some effective bug fixes for 'user_info.py' with logins/logouts and registering. 

### Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh was absent during this sprint.
