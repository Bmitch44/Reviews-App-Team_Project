## Martha Snelgrove
Martha was great to work with for the third sprint. Martha participated as both SCRUM master and as note-taker and also attended every team meeting.  During code reviews, Martha explained her code in a manner such that everyone could understand it. Martha did not have much to implement to get the new features up, so it was unclear what she should do to reach the 40 lines of code required, so she added some CSS to the server to make it look nicer. With regards to the features, Martha added added the logic for creating comments and adding followers.

## Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha was great to work with for the third sprint. Mayesha participated as both SCRUM master and note-taker, and also attended every team meeting. During code reviews, she explained her code well to the group so that everyone could understand it. Mayesha implemented bug fixes for issues with 'user_info.py' that were brought up during a meeting, involving issues with logging in, registering, and logging out. Mayesha also had issues with the 40 lines of code required, so she also implemented some CSS for the templates.    

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady was great to work with for the third sprint, going above and beyond in many aspects of the sprint. Brady participated as both SCRUM master and note-taker, and also attended every team meeting. Brady always had his code implemented extremely quickly and was always willing to lend a helping hand with any issues faced, providing me with assistance with bug fixes when code was not working. Brady was quick and thorough in reviewing PR, and explained his code well in code reviews, making sure we all understood its purpose and how to work with it. He took over what would be assigned to Vansh for this sprint as well, implementing the comment and follow functionality in the 'list_reviews.tpl' and 'list_topics.tpl' file, as well as a new dashboard template 'dashboard.tpl' to display these followed topics.

## Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh's performance was unfortunately not up to par again this sprint. Vansh did not participate as a scrum master or note-taker. Brady took over his responsibilities for this sprint, implementing more template functionality.

## General Notes:
During this sprint, the team seemed to struggle as a whole with rescheduling meetings when a member was unable to make it to a meeting, often resulting in a member giving late notice for not being able to make it. To improve on this, in further meetings, notice would need to be given a few days in advance if a member wanted to reschedule a meeting or hold it online.
