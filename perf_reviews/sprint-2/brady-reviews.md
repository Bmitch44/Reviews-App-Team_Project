# Performance Reviews Sprint 2

### Martha Snelgrove
Martha has continued to excel in her dual roles as note-taker and SCRUM master, providing a stable foundation for our team's communication and meeting structure. Her technical understanding, particularly of the `@property` decorator, is on an upward trajectory. She has delivered essential code components punctually, which were critical for the team's progress. However, her encounter with server issues has delayed the CSS styling task, she eventually figured this out, but it was too close to the pull request deadline to start with the styling. This could have been addressed earlier in the sprint which would've gave more time to complete the tasks.


### Cody Cribb
Cody has equally excelled in his responsibilities as a note-taker and SCRUM master, contributing positively to team organization and meeting management. His proactive maintenance of the `server_app.py` file has been crucial in keeping our server on track. Cody’s development of the `login_check()` method has demonstrated an effective application of the DRY principle, as well as the other methods created to maintain the server. Yet, his transition from coding to creating tests has been slow, which will be an area for development in the coming sprint.


### Mayesha Jashim
In her roles as a note-taker and SCRUM master, Mayesha has maintained a high level of engagement, ensuring detailed documentation and meeting efficiency. She has proactively addressed previously noted errors in her work. Although her initial task completion was timely, she encountered issues that affected the server's functionality, which led to delays. Enhancing her understanding of the system’s interconnectivity will be beneficial for reducing future errors. This will lead to a more invloved way of getting her tasks done, as right now she needs quite a bit of assistance.

### Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh's performance remains a concern as he has not fulfilled his expected duties as a note-taker and SCRUM master. His absence has been noted and has negatively impacted the team's dynamic. His non-participation has led to an increased burden on the other team members, and it is crucial to address this to ensure a balanced distribution of responsibilities.
