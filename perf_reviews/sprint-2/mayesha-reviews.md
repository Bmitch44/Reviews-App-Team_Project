# Performance Reviews

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady is very active in this project, responds almost immediately to any questions and helps out every one. I could always rely on him for helpful reviews on my pull request and even made helpful code suggestions. He is always punctual with making his pull-requests and fixing his bugs. He participated as scrum master and note taker and always made sure we made progress and mentioned tasks that we should cover in order.

## Martha Snelgrove
Martha is active in this project. She is a great SCRUM master, she makes good key points on how to proceed with our project and what new features would be a good addition to our project. She is not the best when it comes to pushing her code in. She will have every bug fixed and her code updated and pushed before the deadline. However, she doesn't make pull request for small changes made earlier which would've helped the code to run and not left dormant as a faulty code. She completed most of her task and moved the rest to sprint 3.

## Cody Cribb 
Cody is an active member and very good at communicating with the group.
He brought up things he needed help with during meetings and got it resolved faster and pushed it in. He was the first to test out postman to find bugs in our code. Participated as scrum master and notetaker. His best feature was to point out issues that we're currently facing and solving them. He made frequent push request to update his code which I found very helpful.

## Vaansh Chaudhary
Vaansh has been out of contanct for the entire sprint. He did not respond to any of the attemp made to contact him. He did not attend any meetings. He was not assigned any specific task. His responsiblies were shared among the active team members for this sprint as well.
