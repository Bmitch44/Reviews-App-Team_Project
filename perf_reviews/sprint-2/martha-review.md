# Performance Reviews Sprint 2

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady is a helpful and engaging team member. He promptly completes all assigned work ad picks up any extra slack on the team due to missing members. He participates fully as both SCRUM master and notetaker. He attended all meetings this sprint. All he code is very clear and well written and he is helpful during code reviews allowing others code to be improved. This sprint Brady helped develop our new PR request systems including several automatic workflows that greatly improved efficiency.

### Cody Cribb
Cody is a pleasure to work with. His code for the `server_app.py` is clear and functions very well, he stayed well on top of his work with the server allowing us to complete our tasks as well. The only slowdown being his tests coming in late where he had to learn a new systekm to test the server, but it was a good learning to take to the next sprint in building in learning time to our planning. Cody is an excellent note taker and SCRUM master participating helpfully in both code reviews and team meetings.

### Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha is an efficient team member and hardworker. She initatially had her code finished but debugging took some time when integrating with the server. This caused some minor delays but was a learning experience for all. She only missed one meeting but this was due to confusion with daylight savings and will not be repeated. She participates fully in meetings both as notetaker and SCRUM master and is helpful during group code reviews.

### Vansh Chaudhary
We are unclear if Vansh is still enrolled in 2005. We have once again attempted to communicate but heard nothing in return, we will try again next sprint.
