## Martha Snelgrove
Martha was great to work with for the second sprint as well. Martha participated as both SCRUM master and as note-taker and also attended every team meeting. Marthaâ€™s implementation of some issues was due to numerous factors, like being unable to get the server running due to issue #147, where she was unable to get the server running. This was also a result of her not having anything to do in relation to her responsibilities, so it was unclear what she should do to reach the 40 lines of code required, so she ended up making miscellaneous bug fixes and additions to the server. Martha also coded some refactoring along with the bug fixes, adhering to DRY and SOLID principles. Martha could do more PR reviews, issue on the KanBan board relating to this. 


## Mayesha Jashim
Mayesha was great to work with for the second sprint as well. Mayesha participated as both SCRUM master and note-taker, and also attended every team meeting, save one, however, this was due to an unfortunate incident involving the time change from daylight savings. During code reviews, she adequately explained her code to the group so that everyone could understand it. Mayesha helped with the implementation of the ability to search reviews by implementing the logic inside user_info.py. Mayesha could potentially do more PR reviews, issue on the KanBan board relating to this. 

## Brady Mitchelmore
Brady was great to work with for the second sprint as well, going above and beyond in many aspects of the sprint. Brady participated as both SCRUM master and note-taker, and also attended every team meeting. Brady always had his code implemented extremely quickly and was always willing to lend a helping hand with any issues faced. He provided guidance on issues that were not his responsibility, and was quick and thorough in reviewing PRs. Brady explained his code well in code reviews, making sure we all understood its purpose and how to work with it. He took over what would be assigned to Vansh for this sprint as well, implementing the additional template functionality as well.

## Vansh Chaudhary
Vansh's performance was unfortunately not up to par again this sprint. Vansh did not participate as a scrum master or note-taker. He was absent from all meetings this sprint and despite more attempts at contact this sprint, he did not respond to any of them. An issue was created on the KanBan board to document this. Brady took over his responsibilities for this sprint, implementing more template functionality.
